Apply for political asylum <br> Political asylum is protection granted by a nation to someone who has left their native country as a political refugee. The problem with this is that deciding what conditions are so bad that political asylum is needed is subjective. Since it is subjective deciding whether or not that an applicant can have refuge in our country can take years. This can expose the applicant to put themselves in more danger. <br> 2. Apply for a student visa <br>A student visa is a non-immigrant visa that grants the owner permission to study in the United States. It is only granted to people enrolled in qualified institutions. The cons of this visa are that the applicant is not allowed to work during the period of time they are in school. This means they have to prove financial support for the whole time they are a student. After graduating international students are left with the choice of either going back to their home or applying for Optional Practical Training (OPT). If they apply they have to find work in their field within 90 days or they are sent back home. If they find a job a common path to citizenship is having their employer sponsor them through the whole green card process, which could take up to 20 years or more and then apply for citizenship 5 years later. </h3> <br> <select id="visa" onchange="select_ending()"> <option value="0">Select Option</option> <option value="1">Option 1</option> <option value="2">Option 2</option>; </select>',
