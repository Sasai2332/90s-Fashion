Apply for a work visa <br> To apply for a work visa the applicant’s employer can sponsor them through the whole green card process. This means one would have to stay at the same company or organization for years. The employer also has to prove that the applicant is not taking jobs away from American worker. To hire an immigrant, US employers must first prove a lack of qualified or willing workers within the US for the postition they’re trying to fill. This whole process can take a few years to just get the job and then getting a green card will take even longer. Also the amount of time it takes for one to become a citizen can depend on the country of birth. There are quotas for each country so if the applicant is from Norway they will probably get their citizenship faster than somone form China. <br> 2.
