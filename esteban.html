Marry the man and then come into the country when he gets citizenship <br> To get become a citizen many people often have to wait in a long line but when marrying a citizen there is no line. The good news is that the person’s children are also granted citizenship too but it is only children that come with not parents or other relatives. Another downside to this is that visiting this man in America can cause complications. A tourist visa is a non-immigrant visa which means before entering the United States the person will have to convince someone at the US Embassy that they will actually leave. If one overstays their tourist visa for less than 180 days they can come back to the country but border officers or people who work at the US Embassy always the discretion to let someone into the country or not. If one overstays their visa for over 180 days but less than one year they will be barred from reentering for 3 years. If the visa is overstayed for a year or more one will be barred from reentering for 10 years. <br> 2.
