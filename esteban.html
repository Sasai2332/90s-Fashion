       '<h3>You have two visible options. Chose one or click next to start over or go back to the home page. <br> 1. Apply for the H2B temporary worker visa and later apply for a green card <br> The H2B temporary worker visa is a visa granted to temporary workers in fields other than agriculture. The visa lasts up to a year at most but with extensions granted it can last three years. The H4 visa is given to the spouse and unmarried children of the H2B visa holder, the same rules that apply to the primary visa holder apply to them too. Applying and receiving a green card is very hard and if the applicant is a high school dropout it makes things even harder. This is because professionals without “extraordinary abilities” or advanced degrees are given lower priority thus typically have to wait for a much longer for a green card. There is a high chance that these people might never get a green card at all. If they receive a green card they can apply for citizenship in five years. <br> 2. Come into the country without papers <br> This is very common for people wanting to come to the country. A few ways of doing this are illegally crossing the northern and southern border or staying in the country even after a visa has expired. Some people believe that undocumented immigrants aren’t needed in the U.S. but in reality, they are a significant part of your society. In 2014 there were around 8 million undocumented immigrants in the workforce and 3.4 million were paying social security taxes, which is sad because they can’t get one or receive the benefits of one. </h3> <br> <select id="visa" onchange="select_ending()"> <option value="0">Select Option</option> <option value="1">Option 1</option> <option value="2">Option 2</option>; </select>',

ICE or Immigration and Customs Enforcement is one of your biggest fears because you see on the news more and more immigrants being deported and even dying in ICE’s custody.
